# Real-Time Translation

This repository provides two implementations for real-time language translation: one using Python with a Tkinter-based GUI and the other using Node.js with a command-line interface.

## Python (Tkinter GUI)

The Python version offers a sleek, user-friendly graphical interface built with Tkinter. It allows users to select a target language from a dropdown menu and input text for translation. A "Translate" button triggers the translation, displaying the result in a neatly styled text box. The interface is designed for ease of use, making it suitable for non-technical users who prefer a visual approach.

### Features:
- Dropdown menu for selecting the target language.
- Instant translation display with a single click.
- User-friendly design with customized styles for better readability.

## Node.js (Command-line Interface)

The Node.js implementation is a lightweight command-line tool that asks users to input the text, source language, and target language codes. It then performs the translation and displays the result in the terminal. This version is ideal for developers or users who prefer working directly in the command line.

### Features:
- Interactive prompts for entering text and language codes.
- Quick and efficient translation within the terminal.
- Simpler setup without the need for a graphical environment.

## Comparison

- **GUI vs. CLI**: The Python GUI version is designed for users who prefer visual interaction, while the Node.js CLI version is for those comfortable with terminal commands.
- **Customization**: The Python version offers more customization with its GUI, whereas the Node.js version is minimalistic and fast.
- **Use Case**: Use the Python GUI for a more intuitive, user-friendly experience, and the Node.js CLI for a straightforward, developer-centric approach.
